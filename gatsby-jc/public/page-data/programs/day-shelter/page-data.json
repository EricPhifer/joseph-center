We designed the day shelter to give homeless families with children 0-5 a safe environment during the day. While clients are able to stay at our community’s homeless shelter at night, until now, there was no place for them during the day. Women with babies had to go to the park, hangout at fast food restaurants all day, ride the city buses or loiter local stores, leaving the children in strollers and car seats all day. ","The day shelter not only provides a safe environment, it’s a place where clients can do laundry, put their children down for naps, and receive home cooked meals. Clients receive mentorship from our staff and volunteers aiding in resume writing, job searches, and connecting them with other resources in our community. With the help of our supporters, The Joseph Center is able to supply families with diapers, toiletries, baby food and clothes, and other necessities. Laundry and shower facilities are on location.
