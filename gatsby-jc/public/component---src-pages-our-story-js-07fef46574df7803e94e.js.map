Our mission is to\n            provide hope, establish stability, encourage resourcefulness and\n            confer a sense of belonging to the greater community.\n          </h2>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"twoColContainer content\">\n          <div className=\"twoCol\">\n            <p>\n              The concept of a Joseph Center was a long-standing vision of the\n              founder Mona Highline. In 2015, Mrs. Highline and a group of women\n              came together to develop the Joseph Center. Through a community\n              needs assessment, the women discovered a gap in services for\n              homeless women with their children. An auxiliary building at a\n              church was offered to the women to open as a day shelter. The\n              Joseph Center opened its doors September 8, 2016 to provide a safe\n              place during the day for homeless families with children. This was\n              our singular focus to empower these women’s lives with purpose.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The Joseph Center was able to help these families with tangible\n              resources, application fees, and rent deposits all provided by\n              community donations. The Joseph Center was located at the\n              auxiliary building for about a year when the church came under new\n              leadership. We were asked to leave and were forced to find a new\n              space.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"twoCol\">\n            <p>\n              The Joseph Center split its services to a building at the\n              Salvation Army and administrative offices at the Center for\n              Independence. At first, we thought this was a setback however it\n              opened the door for us to start a new program called the\n              representative payee. The organization thrived in these new\n              locations for about a year although there were some logistical\n              challenges. That fall, we were once again told that the day\n              shelter program would have to move. Winter was coming. We began\n              actively looking for a new space with the intention of merging all\n              of our services together under one roof.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              A generous donation was given to the Joseph Center to purchase a\n              building. By January 2019, the Joseph Center had a new home and\n              renovations on the building began. The Joseph Center continues to\n              have a day shelter as well as the Joseph Center{' '}\n              <Link to=\"/\">Adult Advocacy Program</Link> (JCAAP) and Generating\n              All Possibilities (GAP) fund.
